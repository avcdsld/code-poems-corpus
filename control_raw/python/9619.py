def srange(s):
    r"""Helper to easily define string ranges for use in Word
    construction. Borrows syntax from regexp '[]' string range
    definitions::

        srange("[0-9]")   -> "0123456789"
        srange("[a-z]")   -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        srange("[a-z$_]") -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz$_"

    The input string must be enclosed in []'s, and the returned string
    is the expanded character set joined into a single string. The
    values enclosed in the []'s may be:

     - a single character
     - an escaped character with a leading backslash (such as ``\-``
       or ``\]``)
     - an escaped hex character with a leading ``'\x'``
       (``\x21``, which is a ``'!'`` character) (``\0x##``
       is also supported for backwards compatibility)
     - an escaped octal character with a leading ``'\0'``
       (``\041``, which is a ``'!'`` character)
     - a range of any of the above, separated by a dash (``'a-z'``,
       etc.)
     - any combination of the above (``'aeiouy'``,
       ``'a-zA-Z0-9_$'``, etc.)
