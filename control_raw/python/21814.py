        Authenticate the given user to the server if he is a valid krb5

                 We don't check if the krb5 principal is allowed to log in on
                 the server, because there is no way to do that in python. So
                 if you develop your own SSH server with paramiko for a cetain
                 plattform like Linux, you should call C{krb5_kuserok()} in
                 your local kerberos library to make sure that the
                 krb5_principal has an account on the server and is allowed
                 to log in as a user.
