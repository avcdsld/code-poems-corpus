def check_origin(self, origin: str) -> bool:
        """Override to enable support for allowing alternate origins.

        The ``origin`` argument is the value of the ``Origin`` HTTP
        header, the url responsible for initiating this request.  This
        method is not called for clients that do not send this header;
        such requests are always allowed (because all browsers that
        implement WebSockets support this header, and non-browser
        clients do not have the same cross-site security concerns).

        Should return ``True`` to accept the request or ``False`` to
        reject it. By default, rejects all requests with an origin on
        a host other than this one.

        This is a security protection against cross site scripting attacks on
        browsers, since WebSockets are allowed to bypass the usual same-origin
        policies and don't use CORS headers.

        .. warning::

           This is an important security measure; don't disable it
           without understanding the security implications. In
           particular, if your authentication is cookie-based, you
           must either restrict the origins allowed by
           ``check_origin()`` or implement your own XSRF-like
           protection for websocket connections. See `these
           <https://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html>`_

           for more.

        To accept all cross-origin traffic (which was the default prior to
        Tornado 4.0), simply override this method to always return ``True``::

            def check_origin(self, origin):
                return True

        To allow connections from any subdomain of your site, you might
        do something like::

            def check_origin(self, origin):
                parsed_origin = urllib.parse.urlparse(origin)
                return parsed_origin.netloc.endswith(".mydomain.com")

        .. versionadded:: 4.0

        """
        parsed_origin = urlparse(origin)
        origin = parsed_origin.netloc
        origin = origin.lower()

        host = self.request.headers.get("Host")

        # Check to see that origin matches host directly, including ports
        return origin == host
