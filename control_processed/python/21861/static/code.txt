        Authenticate to the server interactively.  A handler is used to answer
        arbitrary questions from the server.  On many servers, this is just a
        dumb wrapper around PAM.

        This method will block until the authentication succeeds or fails,
        peroidically calling the handler asynchronously to get answers to
        authentication questions.  The handler may be called more than once
        if the server continues to ask questions.

        The handler is expected to be a callable that will handle calls of the
        form: ``handler(title, instructions, prompt_list)``.  The ``title`` is
        meant to be a dialog-window title, and the ``instructions`` are user
        instructions (both are strings).  ``prompt_list`` will be a list of
        prompts, each prompt being a tuple of ``(str, bool)``.  The string is
        the prompt and the boolean indicates whether the user text should be
        echoed.

        A sample call would thus be:
        ``handler('title', 'instructions', [('Password:', False)])``.

        The handler should return a list or tuple of answers to the server's
        questions.

        If the server requires multi-step authentication (which is very rare),
        this method will return a list of auth types permissible for the next
        step.  Otherwise, in the normal case, an empty list is returned.

        :param str username: the username to authenticate as
        :param callable handler: a handler for responding to server questions
        :param str submethods: a string list of desired submethods (optional)
        :return:
            list of auth types permissible for the next stage of
            authentication (normally empty).

        :raises: `.BadAuthenticationType` -- if public-key authentication isn't
            allowed by the server for this user
        :raises: `.AuthenticationException` -- if the authentication failed
        :raises: `.SSHException` -- if there was a network error
